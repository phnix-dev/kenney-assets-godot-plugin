# Kenny Assets Godot Plugin

This is a Godot plugin designed to make using the Kenny All In One Asset Packer easier.

## Installation

1. Download the addon from the release tab or download the code as a zip.
2. Copy the addons folder to your project. 
3. Enable the plugin in your project settings. (Project > Project Settings > Plugins > Kenney Assets Viewer)

## Warning

- It only works with the [Kenney Game Assets All-in-1](https://kenney.itch.io/kenney-game-assets) zip archive. (version 1.8)
- The zip archive is large and the decompression process can be slow, so do not deactivate the plugin before it has finished unzipping it. 
- When selecting a folder in the import dialog box, you **MUST** be inside the folder and select "Select Current Folder", if you click on "Select This Folder" it will not work!
